 <div class="head1"><strong>Introduction</strong></div> 
 <span><p>The importance of this time period is actually fascinating besides its shortness, in many ways we can still see its reflection in todays reality.
Without a doubt the most remarkable aspect of the the 20s is the fashion, and that's what this article is focused on. Is known
that the way we dress is a reflection of our ideas as partivular indivuduals, and its coincidence with others can describe entire ephocs.
So to understand fashion,
is far not enough to just recognize clothing peaces, we need to understand their psicology, the unspoken meaning behind it and what was happening around the world to lead to it.

 <p class="text2">The crucial accurance that led to such a drastic change from the victorian era to the roaring twenties, was the WW1.
    Which led to two main changes: SOCIAL  and  ECONOMICAL.<br> The first one was more revolutionary for woman, owing them to take a more signifficant role not just in the household but the society. 
    From one side due to the lack of millitaries, they had to take part in the front, mainly as nurses. And the other, 
    the ones who stayed at home , took part in what were considered "men jobs", what ment not just working in fabrics but also carrying mens responsabilities. 
    What allowoed them to have their own salaries and so independence and latter, a right to vote. This independence was clearly reflected in their style, widly known as "Le Garçon" what in translation from french means:
    "the boy". Were the iconic short hair reflected freedom. It allowed more movement and less time to take care for it, so woman coud focus in something else than threir appearence. And all this evolution, occured in jut a 20 year gap starting from the end of Victorian era in the 1900s. Just take a look at the pictures bellow to sight the drastic change in the woman character.  <br></p>

    <!-- foto visotrian style and bob --> <p class="text22"> <br> - It's also important to mention the absence of corsets and any remarking of the femenine figure due to loose clothing. The main reason for it was the lack of materials, to make elaborated designs and the introduction of a standart size in the fabrics, for a faster production. 
     In fact, this loose effect, was created because of the cobination of standarized sizes with malnourished bodies due to the hunger.<br> -Also, some mens habits were addapted, like smoking and playing sports. And here we can study how this incredible equality raise took its place so fast. Because actually "woman rights manifistations" had nothing to do with it.
    It was pure economic change. The moment woman happened to be indispenssible in the industries, the majority of their rights came with it. So as it's logic, being equal to men also brought to looking and acting similarly. 
    <br> <br> In case of men, the main style changes, were basically a simplification of previous designs, due to the same reasons, lack of materials and absence of people who could afford buying elaborated pieces. 
   Some curiosities to be remarked here, can be for example, the reason why facial hair wasn't trending. This was one of the habits inheritated from the war. 
   Due to the popularization of the usage of gas as a weapon, wearing anti gas masks was really common, but the long beards that were popular the previous decade, made it uncomftable and unsafe.
   So shaving became a normal army practice, which stays till today. Another thing to be mentioned, is why we stopped wearing hats if they were so popular back then.
   And the answer again relies in its practical usage. Before becoming a fashion piece, hats had a solid protecting function. If we go back in time, between 1400-1700 wearing hats was just a measure to the unsanitary. They used to have a very wide brim to protect the head from different rubish that 
   was throuwn out of the windows in the narrow streets. If we go forward untill the industrial revolution, in lower classes, it was used as a helmet in the construction sites due to the lack of saffety mesurments. And in higher classes, hats were protecting from the low ceiling in the cars. And we can clearly follow how the modernization of cars coincided with the vanish of hats in the fashion.
   Around the 60s when cars satrted to have a higher ceiling or in the other hand, when cabriolets were becomming popular, so that means, no ceiling at all, there was no need in keep covering from possible injuries. So that's why we don't see hats as much in the second half of the previouss century. And nowadays, hats are solidly used to compliment the outfits.
