        <p>The importance of this time period is actually fascinating; besides its shortness, in many ways we can still see its reflection in today's reality.
             Without a doubt, one of the most remarcable aspects of the 20s is fashion, and that's what this article is focused on. 
             It is known that the way we dress is a reflection of our ideas as particular individuals, and its coincidence with others can describe entire epochs. 
             Understandg fashion, it is far more than just recognizing clothing pieces, we need to understand the psychology,
              the unspoken meaning behind it, and what was happening around the world to lead to it.

    <p> The crucial occurrence that led to a drastic change, from the Victorian era to the roaring twenties, was WW1.
         Which led to two main changes: SOCIAL and ECONOMICAL. <br><br>
         The first one was more revolutionary for women, owing to their ability to take a more significant role not just in the household but in society as a whole.
          On one side, due to the lack of militaries, they had to take part in the front, mainly as nurses.
           And the others, the ones who stayed at home, took part in what were considered "men jobs",
            which meant not just working in fabrics but also carrying men's responsibilities.<br><br>
             That allowed them to have their own salaries and, consequently, independence and, later, a right to vote.
              This independence was clearly reflected in their style, widely known as "Le Garçon" which, in translation from French, means "the boy".
               Were the iconic short hairs a reflection of freedom. It allowed more movement and less time to take care of it, 
               so women could focus on something other than their appearance.<br><br> All this evolution occurred in just a 20-year gap, 
               starting from the end of the Victorian era in the 1900s. Just take a look at the pictures below to see the drastic change in the woman's character. </p> <br>

    <br> Women's fashion at that time is also characterized by the absence of corsets and any remarks of the feminine figure, due to loose clothing. <br> <br>
     The main reason for it was the lack of materials to make elaborate designs and the introduction of a standard size in the fabrics for faster production.
      In fact, this loose effect was created because of the combination of standardized sizes with malnourished bodies due to hunger. <br> <br>
       Also, some men's habits were adapted, like smoking and playing sports. 
       And here we can study how this incredible equality rise took place so fast. 
       Because actually, "women's rights manifestations" had nothing to do with it. It was pure economic change.
        The moment women happened to be indispensable in the industries, the majority of their rights came with it. 
        So, as it's logical, being equal to men made them not just look but act similarly.
    <br><br>
    In the case of men, the main style changes were a simplification of previous designs, 
    due to the same reasons, lack of materials and the absence of people who could afford to buy elaborate pieces.  <br> <br>
    There are curiosities like: why facial hair wasn't trending? <br> 
     And in fact this was one of the habits inherited from the war. Due to the popularization of the usage of gas as a weapon,
      wearing anti-gas masks was really common, but the long beards that were popular the previous decade, made it uncomfortable and unsafe. 
      So shaving became a normal army practice. <br> <br> Another thing to be mentioned is: why we stopped wearing hats if they were so popular back then?  <br> 
      And the answer again relies on its practical usage. Before becoming a fashion piece, hats had a solid protective function. <br> <br>
       If we go back in time, between 1400-1700, wearing hats was just a measure to be unsanitary.
        They used to have a very wide brim to protect the head from different rubbish that was thrown out of the windows in the narrow streets. 
        If we go forward until the industrial revolution, in lower classes, it was used as a helmet on construction sites due to the lack of safety measurements. 
        And in higher classes, hats were protected from the low ceiling in the cars. <br> <br> 
        We can clearly see how the modernization of cars and their accessibility for everyone coincided with the vanishing of hats in fashion.
         Around the 1960s, when cars started to have a higher ceiling or, on the other hand, when cabriolets were becoming popular, 
         which means, no ceiling at all, there was no need to keep covering from possible injuries.
          So that's why we didn't see hats as much in the second half of the previous century. And nowadays, hats are widely used to complement outfits.

 <p class="content"><br><br>After covering the social side of the 20s,
    let's move on to another crucial aspect, the economical. This will focuse particularly on the USA as they are the most influencial economy in the world.
    

    <br> <br>
 The reason why the USA stood out after WW1 in comparison to the rest of the world that was fighting crisis, is pretty simple.
  They entered the war late (1917), which minimized their losses and being across the ocean
   from the center of the conflict helped them to avoid having any battle fronts in their territory.
   So they didn't have to focus their entire economy on recovering. <br> <br>


  This period of time also coincided with the end of the second industrial revolution (1870–1914). 
  Also known as the technological revolution, is characterized by mass production and standardization.
  It opened many new working places and tremendously accelerated urbanization, and also increased immigration. 
  The American economy didn't have competition, so they started to dominate. <br> <br>
  American citizens had better living conditions now that they were in the cities and had many working opportunities. 
  That allowed them, for the first time in history, to have money not just for survival but also for leisure. 
  This is a very crucial aspect to mention because that's when activities like
  traveling, playing sports, going shopping, the party culture, going to the cinema, etc. were incorporated into our daily lives. 
  It's the concept itself to start spending your savings on something that makes you feel good.



   <br> <br> <br>
   In the case of traveling, apart from now having the opportunity to go out, the interest in it was encouraged by the exploring spirit, due to many historical and geographical discoveries at that time. The most remarkable of them being : 
the first flight to the North Pole (1926), the exploration of Antarctica(1929), the underwater explorations and the founding of 
Tutankhamun's Tomb in 1922. The last one impacts directly on fashion. New prints were incorporated, fabrics, jewelry, hairstyles.... all 
trying to simulate the drawings from the inside of pyramids or the accessories Faraons used to wear. 
This obsession over  Egypt even has a name: Egyptomania.
   <br> </p><div class="images"> 
    <img class="foto11" src="./lattest_version_web_files/egypt.jpg" alt="egyptian_outfits_20s">
    <img class="foto12" src="./lattest_version_web_files/times.webp" alt="egyptian_outfits_magazine">
   </div>
   <br> <br>

   

  <br> <br> 
  And here we could arise a doubt of : why, among so many discoveries, only one had so much attention? <br> 
   And the answer relies on how consumerism was raised. 
  It was all thanks to the mass media; TVs, radio, music, films... That allowed the information to be spread quickly and to be heard and seen everywhere. 
  <br> <br>What happened is that the financial backer of the search for Tutankhamun's tomb, Lord George Carnarvon, took advantage of it.
  He made a contract with 'The Times' magazine allowing them access to their work, for it to cover the expenses of the excavations. 
  Such exclusive content had a massive success 
  and everyone wanted to get closer to it and explore the mysteries it had. That's when the industries focused all their products on the new trending topic, Egypt. <br>

 <br> <br> 
 Continuing on mass production, we can discuss a very interesting occurrence that it provoked that lasts till our days, and it's the culture of appearing.
 The 1920s was the moment when social classes started to visually disappear. For the first time in history, working-class people could be seen wearing the same clothes as 
 the wealthier ones.  <br> <br>
 And again, it was due to two factors that were already mentioned: the absence of materials to make the same elaborate and complex pieces as there were before, and now the 
 ability of normal people to afford more. So the society was visually a little more balanced.
 What it provoked was people wanting to show that they belonged to a more comfortable financial situation, than they did by having better clothes.
 Because they could finally afford them. <br> <br> And here is actually the exact point when society started wanting to show that they lived better than 
 they did by the solid purpose of impressing others by appearing. Here we can see a parallel with today's reality, where social media is
 accused of causing the same effect,
 where people only show the successful and happy side of their lives. <br> <br> But It's erroneous to think that it's the fault of digitalization.
 A Hundred years ago, it was completely normal to see absolutely stunningly dressed people coming back to their five-square-meter homes with no water or electricity.
 <br> <br>Others opinions mattered no less back then than nowadays, it was even more important at that time,
  because reputation and social status played a huge role in someone's life. It always did, but now people could fool the system. 
  <br> <br>So it's interesting to think that the concept of trying to seem perfect, actually took place more than a century ago.
 But it's still important to note that social classes disappeared only visually, the wealthiest couldn't drastically stand out any more by just what they wore,
 so their privileges were just shown in other ways. 
 <br> <br> <br> <br> This article provides fundamental information to understand where some things come from and sets an analytical approach. 
 There are many more aspects that can be covered
 to give an even bigger perspective of what shaped fashion. 
 Some of the topics, like: The philosophy during that time, the role cinema played in the clothing industry, political movements, designers, etc... will possibly be covered in
 the next update as this web is still under development.
